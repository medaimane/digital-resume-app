          At FluentU, where language learning transforms into an adventure, my
          role as a Senior Full-Stack Mobile App Engineer has been pivotal in
          shaping the innovative Parrot Language Learning App.{' '}
          <b>Alan P, FluentU’s Founder</b>, echoes his satisfaction:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Mohamed is a very talented and reliable developer - we are lucky to
          work with him. He is very thoughtful and thorough and someone who will
          think of the bigger picture. He is also pleasant to work with and a
          great communicator. Thank you, Mohamed!
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The Parrot app introduced a refreshing approach to language learning
          through interactive, dialogue-based stories, covering languages such
          as English, Spanish, French, German, Mandarin Chinese, Russian,
          Japanese, Korean, and more.
        </p>
        <p>Key Contributions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Collaborated closely with the CEO and UI/UX designer to architect
            and develop the app. Utilized React Native/Expo for mobile,
            React.js, Strapi.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL for Web Admin/Backend,
            and GitHub, ExpoEAS, TestFlight, AWS, and Heroku for CI/CD and
            deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Incorporated cutting-edge AI services, including ChatGPT-4 for
            interactive storytelling lessons, Replicate and MedJourney for image
            generation, Google Speech API for speech-to-text, Elevenlabs for
            text-to-speech, and DeepL Translator for content translation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As of the current status, the Parrot app has been temporarily removed
          from the app store and is undergoing internal testing. Excitingly, the
          decision has been made to merge its innovative features with the main
          FluentU app. Stay tuned for further updates!
